# Things to be done

Here I wrote some points that is found but not solved during development due the lack of time. This is not an issue
but the possible improvement or enhancement in later versions.

## Library

### Bluetooth database (db.h/db.c)
* Consider better database organization using hashmap or similar solution
* Find the way to autogenerate the UUID databases from approved specifications and manufacturers data
* Extend vendor database
* Extend device database

### Loop (loop.h/loop.c)
* Use atomics in critical ops

### Watchdog
* Simplify watchdog.

## iBeacon
 * GTK4 interface for fast demo

## Eddystone
 * GTK4 interface for fast demo

Later, TBD moving into issues to be solved as usual.
